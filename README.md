# Cuspid40
The Cuspid40 is an ortholinear or alpha staggered 40% keyboard which features an XT column and a nav cluster. 
It's meant to be super affordable and easy to solder, just requiring an 0xCB Helios (or any other pro-micro compatible microcontrollers) and a bunch of 1N4148 tht diodes. 
<br><br>
The layout was originally ideated by xahy, while knave created the silkscreen art. The design takes inspirations from boards such as the BOX75, the Froggr and the Shinkansen. The gaps between the keys are purposefully meant to highlight the through hole diodes which are soldered on top of the PCB, and because of this the board is intended to be plateless and no plate files are provided in this repo.

<br><br>
At the moment this is purely a skeleton kit consisting of only the pcb and bottom plate, there are plans for a proper case.
<br><br>
To-Do list: 
- Test Firmware.
- Design 3D printable Case.
